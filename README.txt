Tourism recomendation engine built as an exercise for CodeCademy.

Program lacks a GUI as it was built as an exercise,
but its functionality can be demonstrated using the
test travellers at the end of the script.

The program takes a traveler as a list containing
['name', 'location', ['interests', 'more interests']]

It will then check to see if any stored locations at the
traveler's destination match the traveler's interests, and
prints them.
